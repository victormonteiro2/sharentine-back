### SHARENTINE

We understand these are difficult times, due to quarantine we are spending way more time online, but also sometimes regular social media may be <i>too much</i>. Our idea is easy: share simple activities, such as a book you wanna read, a song/album you are listening to, or ask for movie recommendations.
<br />
<br />
This the 3rd and final project from our full-time web development bootcamp at Ironhack.
